----------COMPONENTS--------------

Two types of components: 

Functional components and Class components


-------------JSX------------------

-Javascript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JavaScript language syntax.
-Write XML-like code for elements and components.
-JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.
-JSX is not a necessity to write React applications.
-JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant.
-JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers.

-----------PROPS VS STATE-------------

Props:                                          State:

-Get passed to the component                    -state is managed within the component
-Function parameters                            -Variables declared in the function body
-Props are immutable                            -State can be changed
-Props: Functional Components                   -useState Hook: Functional Components
 this.props: Class Components                   -this.state: Class Components

-------------SET STATE-----------------

-Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly.

-Code has to bne executed after the state has been updated?

Set State it's asynchronous, so we can use the second parameter from the setState function to get 
the value once the asynchronous function it's done fetching the info.

Example: 

  increment() {
    this.setState(
      {
        count: this.state.count + 1,
      },
      () => {
        console.log("Callback value", this.state.count); --> Exact value
      }
    );
    console.log(this.state.count); --> One value less.
  }

-React groups multiple set state calls into one for better performance. So when you need to use the previous state to render something new:
We pass a function as an argument (instead of the regular object) to fetch the prevState.

      this.setState(prevState => ({
        count: prevState.count + 1
    }))


---------------CONDITIONAL RENDERING--------------------

1- if/else
2- Element variables
3- Ternary conditional operator
4- Short circuit operator
